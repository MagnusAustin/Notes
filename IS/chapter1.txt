     3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading systems to disrupt services.
     4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Intercepting and altering communications between two parties.
     5. **Ransomware**: Malware that encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.

2. **Vulnerability**  
   - A weakness in a system that can be exploited to cause harm.  
   - **Classes of Vulnerability:**
     1. **Software Vulnerabilities**: Flaws in software code like bugs or unpatched systems.
     2. **Hardware Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in physical components, such as chip-level flaws.
     3. **Network Vulnerabilities**: Issues in network configurations or protocols.
     4. **Human Vulnerabilities**: Human errors, such as weak passwords or phishing susceptibility.
     5. **Process Vulnerabilities**: Inadequate security policies or procedures.

3. **Authentication Methods**  
   - **Types:**
     1. **Password-based Authentication**: User credentials are matched against stored passwords.
     2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires two or more authentication factors.
     3. **Biometric Authentication**: Uses unique biological traits, such as fingerprints.
     4. **Token-based Authentication**: Involves a physical or digital token.
     5. **Certificate-based Authentication**: Uses digital certificates to verify identity.

4. **Access Control Policies**  
   - **Types:**
     1. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Users have control over access to their resources.
     2. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Access is dictated by central authority based on classifications.
     3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access is assigned based on roles within an organization.
     4. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access is determined by policies using attributes.
     5. **Rule-Based Access Control**: Access based on a set of rules defined by the system administrator.

5. **Authentication Using Tokens**  
   - Tokens are generated and exchanged during the authentication process.
     1. **Process**: User credentials are validated, and a token is issued.
     2. **Token Use**: The token is used for subsequent requests without re-entering credentials.
     3. **Session Management**: Tokens can be time-bound and revoked when a session ends.
     4. **Types of Tokens**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth tokens, etc.
     5. **Security**: Tokens are encrypted to ensure secure transmission.

6. **RBAC vs. ABAC**  
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
     1. Access is granted based on roles.
     2. Easier to manage in static environments.
     3. Simplifies access control by grouping users.
     4. Less flexible in dynamic environments.
     5. Best for organizations with clearly defined roles.
   - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
     1. Access decisions based on attributes like user, environment, and resource.
     2. More granular and flexible.
     3. Suitable for dynamic and complex environments.
     4. Policy-based and scalable.
     5. Requires careful planning and management of attributes.

7. **Access Control in BIBA Model**  
   - The BIBA model is focused on data integrity.
     1. **No Write Up**: Users cannot write data to a higher integrity level.
     2. **No Read Down**: Users cannot read data from a lower integrity level.
     3. **Strict Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized data modifications.
     4. **Invocation Property**: Ensures that subjects cannot invoke objects at a higher integrity level.
     5. **Access Control**: Achieved through rules that maintain data integrity and prevent corruption.

8. **CIA Triad Model of Network Security**  
   - **Components:**
     1. **Confidentiality**: Ensures that information is only accessible to those authorized.
     2. **Integrity**: Ensures data accuracy and consistency, preventing unauthorized modifications.
     3. **Availability**: Ensures that data and resources are available to authorized users when needed.
     4. **Protection Measures**: Encryption for confidentiality, checksums for integrity, redundancy for availability.
     5. **Balanced Security**: Effective security solutions consider all three components.

9. **Bell LaPadula (BLP) Model**  
   - **Access Modes:**
     1. **Read (Simple Security Property)**: No read up – users cannot read data at a higher security level.
     2. **Write (Star Property)**: No write down – users cannot write data to a lower security level.
     3. **Access Modes**: Read, Write, Append.
     4. **Security Levels**: Confidentiality-focused with clearances and classification levels.
     5. **Properties**: Enforces strict confidentiality controls to prevent data leakage.

10. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**  
    - Access is granted based on multiple attributes.
      1. **Attributes**: Include user characteristics, resource characteristics, environment conditions.
      2. **Policy-based**: Access decisions are made based on policies combining these attributes.
      3. **Flexibility**: Allows for complex access controls in dynamic environments.
      4. **Scalability**: Scales well with large, diverse organizations.
      5. **Granularity**: Provides fine-grained control over access.

11. **Defense Strategies and Techniques**  
    - **Strategies:**
      1. **Defense in Depth**: Layered security measures to protect against attacks.
      2. **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust; every access request must be verified.
      3. **Least Privilege**: Users are given the minimum access necessary.
      4. **Segmentation**: Dividing networks to contain breaches.
      5. **Redundancy**: Backup systems and processes to ensure availability.
    - **Techniques:**
      1. **Encryption**: Protects data in transit and at rest.
      2. **Firewalls**: Monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
      3. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Detect and respond to potential threats.
      4. **Patching**: Regularly updating software to fix vulnerabilities.
      5. **User Education**: Training users on security best practices.
