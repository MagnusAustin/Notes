    <h1>IoT Protocols and Standards</h1>

    <h2>1. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)</h2>
    <h3>RFID System Overview:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>RFID systems consist of a <strong>tag (transponder)</strong> and a <strong>reader</strong>.</li>
        <li>The <strong>tag</strong> includes an integrated circuit and an antenna, attached to the object being identified.</li>
        <li>The <strong>reader</strong> communicates with the tag using RF waves to retrieve the tag's identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frequency Bands:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LF (Low Frequency)</strong>: 125 kHz to 134.2 kHz.</li>
        <li><strong>HF (High Frequency)</strong>: 13.56 MHz.</li>
