>
        <ul>
            <li>Each document is assigned a similarity score based on the ratio of its probability of being relevant to the probability of being non-relevant.</li>
            <li>Documents are ranked in decreasing order of their probability of relevance.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Documents are theoretically ranked by their probability of being relevant, which can improve retrieval accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial Guess:</strong> The need to guess the initial separation of documents into relevant and non-relevant sets.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Weights:</strong> The model does not consider the frequency of index terms within documents; all weights are binary.</li>
            <li><strong>Independence Assumption:</strong> Assumes index terms are independent, which may not always be practical. However, this assumptionâ€™s impact is unclear.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Fuzzy Set Model</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Core Concept:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The Fuzzy Set Model is based on fuzzy set theory, which deals with classes that have undefined boundaries.</li>
            <li>It models the approximate or vague matching between documents and queries by assigning degrees of membership (between 0 and 1) to documents in fuzzy sets defined by query terms.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fuzzy Set Theory:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Membership Function:</strong> Represents the degree of membership of elements in a fuzzy set, with values ranging from 0 (no membership) to 1 (full membership).</li>
            <li><strong>Key Operations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complement:</strong> The opposite of a fuzzy set.</li>
                    <li><strong>Union:</strong> Combination of two or more fuzzy sets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intersection:</strong> Common elements of two or more fuzzy sets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fuzzy sets are used to represent vagueness and imprecision in various domains.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fuzzy Information Retrieval:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Query Expansion:</strong> The set of index terms in a query is expanded with related terms from a thesaurus, allowing the retrieval of additional relevant documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Term-Term Correlation:</strong> Uses a correlation matrix to calculate the relationship between a document and its fuzzy index terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Algebraic Operations:</strong> Adopts algebraic sums and products (rather than max and min) to compute the overall degree of membership of a document in the fuzzy set defined by the query.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fuzzy Retrieval Features:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spelling Variations:</strong> Locates similar spellings of words to account for spelling errors, increasing recall but potentially decreasing precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Expansion:</strong> Includes terms with similar spellings and structures to the query term, giving more weight to those with similar word lengths and character positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A fuzzy search for "computer" might include "compiter," "computter," and "compute." It may exclude unrelated valid words (e.g., "commuter") or include them with a lower ranking.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Practical Use:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Fuzzy retrieval systems may allow users to specify the maximum number of terms included in the expanded query.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Extended Boolean Model</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Core Concept:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The Extended Boolean Model enhances the classic Boolean model by incorporating partial matching and term weighting, combining features of both Boolean and vector models.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Limitations of Traditional Boolean Retrieval:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>No term weighting, leading to the absence of ranking in the answer set.</li>
            <li>Results may be either too large or too small.</li>
            <li>Modern IR systems have largely moved away from the Boolean model due to these limitations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Adoption of Vector Model:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Most modern systems use vector retrieval because it is simple, fast, and provides better retrieval performance.</li>
            <li>The Extended Boolean Model is an alternative approach that integrates Boolean query formulations with the vector model's characteristics.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Term Weighting:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Involves assigning importance to an index term based on its representation of the associated concept in the document.</li>
            <li>Weighting helps differentiate the extent to which a concept is described in items within the database.</li>
            <li>Term weights are typically normalized between 0 and 1, with higher weights indicating stronger representation of the concept.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Challenges with Manual Weighting:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Manual assignment of weights adds complexity and overhead for the indexer.</li>
            <li>Requires more complex data structures to store weights.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Query Process:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Weights assigned to index terms are used to calculate a scalar rank value, predicting the likelihood that an item satisfies the query.</li>
            <li>Results are presented in descending order of rank value, with weights reflecting the significance users place on each term.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Structured Text Model</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Structured Text Retrieval Model Overview:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Structured text retrieval models combine information on text content with document structure, allowing more complex and precise queries.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Types of Structured Text Retrieval Models:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model Based on Non-Overlapping Lists:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proposed by Burkowski:</strong> Documents are divided into non-overlapping text regions (e.g., chapters, sections, subsections) collected into separate lists.</li>
                    <li>Multiple lists are created for different types of text divisions.</li>
                    <li>A single inverted file is built for searching both index terms and text regions.</li>
                    <li>Queries can select regions based on the presence or absence of words or other regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Query Examples:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select a region containing a specific word.</li>
                            <li>Select a region not containing any other region.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Model Based on Proximal Nodes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proposed by Navarro and Baeza-Yates:</strong> Allows the creation of independent hierarchical indexing structures (e.g., chapters, sections, paragraphs) over the same document text.</li>
                    <li>Nodes in these hierarchies represent text regions, and distinct hierarchies may overlap.</li>
                    <li>Queries refer to nodes from only one hierarchy, enabling faster query processing but reducing expressiveness.</li>
                    <li>Hierarchical indexing supports nested text regions in the answer set.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Searching for sections containing the word "holocaust" involves traversing the inverted list and matching structural components in the hierarchy.</li>
                    <li>The query language supports regular expressions, references to structural components, and their combinations, balancing expressiveness and efficiency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Models for Browsing</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>General Overview:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browsing vs. Searching:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Browsing:</strong> The user explores the document space looking for interesting references without posing a specific query.</li>
                    <li><strong>Searching:</strong> The user has a clearer goal and poses specific queries to find information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Types of Browsing:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flat Browsing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flat Organization:</strong> The user explores documents organized in a flat manner (e.g., dots on a 2D plane, or a list).</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> The user searches for correlations among documents or keywords of interest.</li>
                    <li>Keywords found during browsing can be added to

 the original query for better contextualization (relevance feedback).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Browsing a web page using arrows and scrollbars.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> There may be no indication of the broader context on the current page or screen.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Structure Guided Browsing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Organization:</strong> Documents are organized in a structured hierarchy, such as directories grouping related topics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Browsing an electronic book where chapters, sections, and text form different levels of content.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> A good UI allows moving up or down these levels, helping the user keep track of context.</li>
                    <li>Additional features like a history map can identify recently visited classes, useful for navigating large structures.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Hypertext Model</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sequential Nature of Written Text:</strong> Written text is typically designed to be read in a sequence.</li>
            <li>Skipping portions of the text can lead to miscommunication and loss of the writer's intended message.</li>
            <li>Sequential reading is essential to fully grasp the writerâ€™s message.</li>
            <li><strong>Need for Non-Sequential Access:</strong> Sometimes, specific information (e.g., regional wars in Europe) is hard to find through sequential reading.</li>
            <li>A different organizational structure is needed to access such specific information.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Hypertext:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Hypertext is an interactive navigational structure that allows non-sequential browsing of text on a computer screen.</li>
            <li>It consists of <strong>nodes</strong> (text regions) connected by <strong>directed links</strong> forming a graph structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Nodes and Links:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each node represents a text region (e.g., chapter, section, Web page).</li>
                    <li>Links between nodes allow movement from one text region to another (e.g., moving from node A to node B).</li>
                    <li>Links are often attached to specific strings in the text, marked for user interaction (e.g., different color, underlined).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clicking on a marked string in the text follows the directed link to a new text region.</li>
                    <li>The process of navigating through hypertext is like traversing a directed graph, visualizing a flow of information designed by the hypertext creator.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
