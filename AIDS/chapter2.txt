1. Phases of NLP
1. **Lexical Analysis**:
   - Identifies and analyzes the structure of words.
   - Lexicon refers to the collection of words and phrases in a language.
   - Divides text into paragraphs, sentences, and words.

2. **Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)**:
   - Analyzes words in a sentence for grammar.
   - Arranges words to show their relationships.
   - Rejects sentences that do not conform to grammatical rules (e.g., "The school goes to boy").

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Extracts the exact or dictionary meaning from the text.
   - Checks the text for meaningfulness.
   - Maps syntactic structures to objects in the task domain (e.g., disregards sentences like "hot ice-cream").

4. **Discourse Integration**:
   - Considers the meaning of the current sentence in the context of the preceding sentence.
   - Helps derive the meaning of the succeeding sentence.

5. **Pragmatic Analysis**:
   - Reinterprets what was said based on what it actually meant.
   - Involves understanding language aspects that require real-world knowledge.





2. Design principles of cognitive systems
1. **Standardize**:
   - Ensure consistency in how devices work to prevent errors.
   - Similar devices should operate in the same way.

2. **Use Stereotypes**:
   - Leverage commonly held expectations in design.
   - Stereotypes are conventions generally followed, similar to standardization.

3. **Match Controls to Equipment Layout**:
   - Align controls with the physical layout of equipment for intuitive use.

4. **Simplify Presentation of Information**:
   - Provide simplified displays to avoid overwhelming users.
   - Complexity should be reduced depending on the situation.

5. **Present Information in Appropriate Detail**:
   - Information should be organized and easy to understand.
   - Good design leads to user-friendly systems.

6. **Present Clear Images**:
   - Ensure images are visible, distinguishable, and interpretable.
     - **Visibility**: Messages must be visible and unobstructed.
     - **Distinguishability**: Messages should be distinct from surrounding signals.
     - **Interpretability**: Messages should be easy to interpret and match user training.

7. **Use Redundancies**:
   - Provide the same information in more than one way to prevent mistakes.

8. **Use Patterns**:
   - Present information as patterns for quicker and more accurate understanding.
   - Grouping controls in patterns can aid user comprehension.

9. **Provide Variable Stimuli**:
   - Vary stimuli to avoid sensory fatigue and ensure information is noticed.
   - Avoid excessive use of a single method for presenting information.

10. **Provide Instantaneous Feedback**:
    - Offer immediate feedback to users to help them identify errors quickly.





3. Natural Language Processing in Support of a Cognitive System
1. **Core Ability of Cognitive Systems**:
   - NLP is a fundamental capability in cognitive computing systems.
   - It helps computers process and understand human language.

2. **Technical Processes Behind NLP**:
   - Involves machine learning techniques, computational linguistics, and statistical analysis across training corpora.

3. **Advancements in AI and NLP**:
   - The rise of AI technologies has driven interest in interacting with computers using spoken human language.
   - There is increasing demand for NLP applications.

4. **Automation and Efficiency**:
   - NLP is widely used for automating information-intensive tasks.
   - It offers benefits like operational and production efficiencies, and more effective data analysis.

5. **Ultimate Goal of NLP**:
   - To enable computers to achieve human-like comprehension of text and language.
   - This would allow computers to understand, infer, summarize, translate, and generate accurate and natural human text and language.
