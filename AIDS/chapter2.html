    <h1>3. Phases of NLP</h1>
    <h2>1. Lexical Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifies and analyzes the structure of words.</li>
        <li>Lexicon refers to the collection of words and phrases in a language.</li>
        <li>Divides text into paragraphs, sentences, and words.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An analyzes words in a sentence for grammar.</li>
        <li>Arranges words to show their relationships.</li>
        <li>Rejects sentences that do not conform to grammatical rules (e.g., "The school goes to boy").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Semantic Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Extracts the exact or dictionary meaning from the text.</li>
        <li>Checks the text for meaningfulness.</li>
        <li>Maps syntactic structures to objects in the task domain (e.g., disregards sentences like "hot ice-cream").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Discourse Integration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Considers the meaning of the current sentence in the context of the preceding sentence.</li>
